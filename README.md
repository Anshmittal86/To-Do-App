## Description

This is a modern To-Do app that allows you to easily edit, delete, and track the completion status of your tasks. All your to-do data is securely stored in localStorage, so you donâ€™t have to worry about losing your information. Additionally, the app features a dynamic chart to display the number of completed tasks versus remaining tasks.

For a customizable user experience, you can switch between light and dark modes to suit your preference.

## Features

**Direct Task Editing:** Modify your to-dos directly from the interface.
**Task Deletion:** Remove tasks easily when they are no longer needed.
**Task Status Toggle:** Check off tasks as completed and uncheck them to mark them as pending.
**Light and Dark Modes:** Switch between light and dark themes for a comfortable viewing experience.
**Dynamic Completion Chart:** Visualize the status of completed tasks with an interactive chart.
**Local Storage:** Your data is securely stored in local storage, ensuring itâ€™s preserved even if you close the app.
